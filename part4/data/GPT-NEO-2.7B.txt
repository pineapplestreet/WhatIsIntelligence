Buck did not read the article. But he was intrigued. He had not heard of the woman, a poet. He had already been taken to the Museum of Art and Science twice, but he'd spent a lot of time there and so knew the names of the exhibits. He had not been to the Museum of Natural History or the Metropolitan Museum. The museums he was familiar with offered very little that was interesting and not much besides the usual objects of curiosity, such as the dinosaurs and ancient Egyptian mummies. Buck did not think museums were much of a destination. He thought they were the same as any other big city. But he was wrong. While he doubted that Buck and any of the other kids on the playground would ever be the type

Buck lived at a big house in a gated community.

The night before he was supposed to show, he'd invited his parents over for dinner. They'd laughed about it like they did everything with Buck, said it was his idea. His parents weren't crazy about having their son around.

He wanted to get them to a place where he could show them something new. Something no one knew about except him. He didn't want them to know he'd been stealing before. And especially not that he'd been doing it in a church while people were listening in.

So, he'd come up with this scheme to have the best of both worlds. Get his parents and his church to talk about a book he

And over this great demesne Buck kept his word and he turned the
corner of the great road at the end of the street and he entered
into the home. But he left a few pieces of gold.

"How much is it?" said a woman who waited on him.

"Seventy-five dollars," answered the man. Then he looked at her with
eyes of kindness a little deeper than any he had ever before
witnessed.

In a little while she left, and within five minutes Buck himself came
in, also with a light heart. But he left a few bits of gold.

"How much is it?" asked the woman.

"Sevent

But Buck was neither house-dog nor hunting dog. And besides, it couldn't be the real Buck. It had to be another animal, something made real to the people like a dream. So she was sure it couldn't be real.

But it was.

"Where is he?" she said. "I need to find him."

"You can't," the black thing said. The word was full of power, of fear.

It was the words of a magic spell, to let no one find the real Buck. So that all three of them were alone, and this black thing would be the only Buck for the people to talk to.

"I can't do anything for you,"

His father, Elmo, a huge man with a large belly and black curly hair, was the first in his family to graduate from high school. When his father, a skilled welder, died in an accident two years later, his stepfather and grandfather stepped in and provided for him and his sister, Lisa, by working at various factories. He went to college, worked in the printing business, and took night classes. He was the only black student in the class.

Later, he went to work first at a factory that made toys and then, after receiving a master’s degree in business, he started a company that made toy animals. On Valentine’s Day, 2001, he married his longtime girlfriend, Angela

And this was the manner of our destruction."

A cold, metallic, deathly chill ran up my spine and into my skull. I could feel it radiating from my feet. I had seen the ghostly apparitions of the murdered men. Now I had seen it. In a ghostly, spectral shroud.

There was nothing I could do about it. I just had to watch the man. If I didn't see the ghost, then maybe the law would catch up with him. But the ghost would just turn up in another village, and another, taking his place among the mourners.

I turned away from him. He must have seen me move. He stopped, took a long pause, then shook himself

The Judge was at a cocktail party in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he learned about the new world. It was the first time he heard people speak a foreign language, and he thought that was an act of genius. He decided then and there that he would speak the language of the United States instead of one of the nations of the world. So, he made up his mind right then and there: He was going to be a lawyer.

The first time he tried to study law, he realized the first impression the judge had made on him was the wrong one.

“The first thing I did, I went to the library, and I was the first person who came in there,” he said. “They

Buck had accepted the invitation, without saying a word.

"You don't even have to see him," said Joe. "I'll come if you'll just talk to him."

"He doesn't need to talk to you," said Buck. "You're a friend, though."

"So what do you need me here for?"

"I want you to give Buck some advice."

"What's the advice?"

"That he should sell out and get out of this racket and get some other job that pays his bills."

"And how are you supposed to get that advice from another guy?"

"Buck, I can't leave him."

"Well

The next he knew, he was lying on the floor of his cell with his back against the wall. His wrists and ankles were tied and his mouth gagged with rags.

“Wake up,” he heard. “I’m coming in to get you!”

Perez sighed and rolled over. His eyes opened slowly to see the face of his cell’s head of security, who had been standing guard to the side, looking in.

“Are you awake?” he asked.

“Yes,” he said.

“Are you hungry?”

“Yes, but I can’t smell

His hand was wrapped in a white bandage, but it didn't take long for me to realize that the wound was a flesh wound, not a broken bone, and it wasn't bleeding at all.

"I think I'm going to have to ask you to step away from my case," Breslin said as he stood up. I didn't know if it was just his usual gruffness, or if he was genuinely rattled by the situation. "You're going to have to turn over some of your property to the city so you won't be a danger to yourself or anyone near you."

"I'm not _dangerous_," I said, and I realized I never should have used the term.


The kidnapper undid the bandage. "I'm going with you, you dumb ass."

"Not just yet, kiddo," the officer said. "As soon as you're free—"

"I want to talk to her."

"You got a pass?"

"She's my hostage. That means I'm responsible for her well-being."

The officer sighed. "You can try to persuade me, but it's just not going to happen. I don't have time."

The bandit stepped into the light. She was an hour late at first, but then was very quickly back on time. She had to be held at gunpoint and handcuffed again. But after

Dazed, suffering intolerable pain from multiple sclerosis (MS), David Schuman woke up with an unexpected gift in his pocket: a bottle of morphine.

“I felt this deep in my gut,” he recalled. “I’ve had friends die. I’ve been very close to my whole family dieing. And this is just as real as any of it. This gave me strength to go on.”

Schuman had spent the previous three weeks in a coma after an aneurysm in his brain ruptured. He lost most of what he had known and, at the time of his recovery, was not even hopeful he would recover from the devastation of his health.



There he lay for the night, a small, shrivelled body wrapped in a sheet. In his right hand was a bloodstained knife, its blade now bloodied. With a deep groan, he twisted and turned. He didn't speak, didn't breathe, just groaned and whimpered. I found myself holding my breath. I didn't want to be here when he woke up. I didn't know what I was doing here.

I had to move. I had to do something. I heard my mother's voice, talking about things I didn't know. _It's time you grew up, you stupid girl_, she was saying. I had to move. It was just a nightmare.

So

But the saloon-keeper let him know at once, that if he didn't have the
faintness, he would.

Now it became an order from the landlord, that if he didn't have the
faintness, he should have a drink.

Now it became a command, from the captain, that he should stand his
saddle.

Now it became even an order, from the men themselves, that they would
not shoot till his horse-flesh came to be known. For they could not
do it, if they did not see how many times he had already gone up to
the bar on a Sunday evening, and had had his horse's flesh served him.



For two days and nights this year, the wind gusted with unseasonable ferocity, tearing off the roofs of the two-story houses and shaking them like reeds in a river. Not to mention the heavy snow with which it struck.

It was midwinter, a cold that can come only in February or March, and yet for two days and nights the wind shrieked through the narrow streets of the district of Banská Bystrica in north-western Slovakia, causing a sensation that might even have been mistaken for the opening night of an opera.

The only way to get rid of the storm was to abandon the two apartments on the first floor of a modest house, and in the basement of a three

He was glad for one thing: that she was at least talking to her mother. And that made her feel guilty all over again. But it was true. She was glad for her mother's talk and her mother's presence.

"Yes." Her mother smiled; her eyes shone with a soft light. "We'll have to find out a way to keep you from making an enemy of someone we love."

"You don't think it's going to be as easy as that?"

"No."

"Why?"

Her mother looked at her; but her eyes did not hold the answer. "I think it's going to be very hard." Then, after a moment: "Well, it's

Four men gingerly carried the unconscious girl into a nearby alley. No one wanted to get out their guns and risk drawing unwanted attention. The alley was empty when they arrived. They lowered the girl in, then pulled down the hood on her coat and covered her head. The girl's eyelids slowly opened. The bloodstain on her white school uniform looked, from this distance, like a dark red stain. She blinked, then gave a startled "W" or "H" as she focused on her surroundings. She turned to the men.

"Who's there?" she asked in a weak voice.

"The police," one of the men replied.

The girl's eyes looked around frantically. For a split second

There was an instantaneous scattering of voices. The crowd began to move forward, the shouts of encouragement rising in volume. At the front, the men began to march; the cheers rose in volume. They marched toward the center of the clearing, and they moved together, their voices ringing out.

'Rise up, my people! Your future and your lives depend on you!' shouted the leader of this new wave, the one who had been sent by the king to rally the people.

From the crowd, a rousing cheer of, "Yes!" rang out.

'The time is at hand!' called the leader, the one who was going to save the people.

The crowd repeated, 'Yes!'


Buck rushed at the door just as it cracked open behind him. He took a step forward and was about to go through when it slammed shut. He looked up to see a tall, heavyset man in a heavy black suit. His eyes were wild.

"You're coming with us," he said.

Buck was in shock at the words. He looked at the man in the suit, trying to think if he had ever seen him before. No, he hadn't. He was not supposed to be here. He had been waiting for more than an hour for the other man to come. And he had just run over in the parking lot to get here. He had tried, and they had stopped him for

And Buck was truly a legend. He'd been a scout for the St. Louis Cardinals. He'd pitched in the majors, and he'd pitched three World Series games. But he had a story that was as unique as it was inspirational.

Buck was a big, powerful, six-foot-four, 225-pound athlete. He was a great boxer, too: He won the Intercity-Panhandle Athletic Club heavyweight boxing championship a few times. He had a terrific all-around athleticism. And he was really good at basketball, baseball, football, and track.

He also had serious musical side. He played clarinet in the band at the Catholic High School. That led to his first love, music:
